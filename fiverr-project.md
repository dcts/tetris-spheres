# Fiver Project Description
I'm programming an open source clone of tetris effect and need the tetris blocks as SVGs and PNGs. I want to have similar or same style as in the original game [**TETRIS EFFECT**](https://knowtechie.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tetris-effect.jpg), but my game will be static, so the blocks will not change in color. I just need the following static assets:

## 1. single square (filled)
As you may have noticed, the squares are not perfect squares. They have a bit of a buckle. Try adapting that shape. Here some examples:

## 2. single square (stroke with a dot in the middle)

## 3. single square (only stroke, no fill, no dot)
same as number 2 above (but without the dot in the middle).

## 4. All 7 Tetrominos (only stroke, no fill, blocks not seperated)

here you can see all 7 shapes i need for this setting:<br>

Colorwise I'd like to copy the blue color theme from the examples, but if you want you can tryout also different color themes (red, purple). I could pay additional 5$ for 1 or 2 additional color themes. The background should be transparent so i can use the assets on a changing background. Let me know if you have any questions (you can contact me on fiverr or via mail thomas.starzynski@unibas.ch).
